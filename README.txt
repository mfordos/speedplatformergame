To play this game, you can't just click on index.html and have the game pop up in your browser. Due to security and blah blah blah you
have to run a web sever to play the game.

Here's how:

1. open cmd
2. "cd /"
3. "npm install http-server -g"
4. "cd /directory location of this project"
5. "http-server -c-1 -a localhost -p 8000"
6. open browser to localhost:8000
